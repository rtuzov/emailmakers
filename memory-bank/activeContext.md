# Active Context - Email-Makers Agent System

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Task**: Complete agent system optimization and migration to OpenAI Agents SDK

## Key Achievements
- Phase 0: Complete transfer tools redesign with file-based handoffs ✅
- Phase 1: Context parameter integration across all specialists ✅
- Phase 2: Content Specialist enhancement completed ✅
- Phase 3: Technical specification system completed ✅
- Asset preparation tools integration completed ✅
- Technical specification generation system completed ✅
- Critical data loss problem resolved ✅
- OpenAI SDK patterns implemented ✅
- All Zod schemas updated for OpenAI API compatibility ✅

## Current Status
**MAJOR MILESTONE**: Critical integration gap successfully resolved

### Technical Integration Details
- ✅ Asset preparation tools (collector, optimizer, validator, manifest generator)
- ✅ Technical specification generator with validation
- ✅ OpenAI API compatibility (`.optional()` → `.nullable()` migration)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation success
- ✅ Next.js build success
- ✅ Integration tests passing (13/13 tests passed)

### Files Successfully Integrated
- `/src/agent/specialists/content-specialist-tools.ts` - Updated with asset preparation and technical spec tools
- `/src/agent/tools/asset-preparation/` - All tools migrated to `.nullable()` patterns
- `/src/agent/tools/technical-specification/` - All tools migrated to `.nullable()` patterns
- All tools now properly exported in `contentSpecialistTools` array

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check` - Success
- ✅ Next.js build: `npm run build` - Success
- ✅ All OpenAI API compatibility issues resolved
- ✅ All 63 pages building successfully

## Quality Approach Maintained
Following the user's guidance: "не торопись, время есть, главное качественно" (don't rush, there's time, focus on quality)

### "Ultrathink" Approach Applied
- Used sequential thinking for complex problem analysis
- Identified root cause of integration gap
- Systematic resolution of schema compatibility issues
- Comprehensive testing verification

## Next Steps
1. Phase 4: Logging & Observability implementation
2. Phase 5: Design Specialist modernization
3. Phase 6: Quality & Delivery enhancement
4. Continue with systematic phase completion

## Technical Notes
- Following OpenAI Agents SDK best practices
- Using context parameter for data flow
- File-based handoff system working
- All tools properly integrated into contentSpecialistTools array
- Campaign folder structure validated and working
- Schema validation patterns updated for OpenAI API compatibility

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Data Flow**: Specialists now receive complete results from previous specialists
2. **Context Preservation**: Context parameter system working correctly
3. **File Structure**: Campaign folder structure enables proper handoffs
4. **API Compatibility**: All schemas properly formatted for OpenAI API
5. **Build Success**: System compiles and builds without errors

**Status**: Ready to continue with next phases of optimization.
