  - Comprehensive path validation with file system checks
  - Standardized error handling with `CampaignPathError`
  - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous validation
- **Benefits**: Eliminates inconsistent path extraction patterns across specialists

### 2. **Enhanced Context Manager** (`/src/agent/core/context-manager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Standardized context management for all agent `run()` calls
- **Features**:
  - Rich context structure with correlation IDs and tracking
  - Workflow management with phase progression
  - Enhanced data flow tracking between specialists
  - Quality metrics and monitoring configuration
  - Context validation and snapshots for debugging
- **Benefits**: Complete traceability and standardized context across the entire pipeline

### 3. **Comprehensive Handoff Validator** (`/src/agent/core/handoff-validator.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures data completeness and dependencies before specialist transfers
- **Features**:
  - Schema validation using existing Zod schemas
  - Dependency checking for required data fields
  - File existence validation for campaign assets
  - Consistency validation across data sources
  - Detailed validation results with warnings and errors
- **Benefits**: Prevents failed handoffs due to incomplete or invalid data

### 4. **File Operations with Retry Logic** (`/src/agent/core/file-operations-retry.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Robust file operations with exponential backoff retry mechanism
- **Features**:
  - Configurable retry counts, delays, and error patterns
  - Exponential backoff with maximum delay limits
  - Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
  - Type-safe operation wrappers for all file operations
  - Specialized functions for JSON, access, stat, copy operations
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability for file system operations under high load

### 5. **Comprehensive Error Types** (`/src/agent/core/error-types.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Hierarchical error classification for better debugging
- **Features**:
  - Rich error context and metadata
  - Troubleshooting hints for each error type
  - Integration with retry and monitoring systems
  - Specialized error classes for different operation types
  - Error severity levels and retryability flags
- **Benefits**: Enhanced debugging capabilities and better error handling strategies

### 6. **Enhanced Context Usage Guide** (`/src/agent/core/ENHANCED_CONTEXT_USAGE.md`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for context system usage
- **Features**:
  - Best practices and patterns
  - Migration guide from basic context
  - API reference and examples
  - Integration points documentation
- **Benefits**: Ensures consistent and optimal usage of the enhanced context system

## ðŸ”§ Integration Points

### Updated Files with New Patterns:

1. **Main Agent** (`/src/agent/main-agent.ts`)
   - Integrated enhanced context creation for all agent runs
   - Added correlation ID tracking throughout workflow
   - Enhanced error handling with new error types

2. **Specialist Finalization Tools** (`/src/agent/core/specialist-finalization-tools.ts`)
   - Implemented retry logic for all file operations
   - Added comprehensive error handling with specific error types
   - Replaced hardcoded patterns with proper error throwing

3. **Content Finalization Tool** (`/src/agent/core/content-finalization-tool.ts`)
   - Enhanced file reading with retry mechanisms
   - Improved error handling for data extraction
   - Eliminated hardcoded fallback values

4. **API Integration** (`/src/app/api/agent/run-improved/route.ts`)
   - Enhanced context management integration
   - Improved error handling and monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements Summary

### Before vs After:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Path Resolution** | Inconsistent extraction patterns | Centralized `CampaignPathResolver` utility |
| **Context Management** | Basic context objects | Rich, validated context with correlation IDs |
| **Error Handling** | Generic errors, hardcoded fallbacks | Comprehensive error types, explicit error throwing |
| **File Operations** | Basic fs operations | Retry logic with exponential backoff |
| **Handoff Validation** | Minimal validation | Comprehensive schema and dependency validation |
| **Debugging** | Limited context information | Rich context snapshots and correlation tracking |

### Performance & Reliability:

- **Retry Logic**: 3-5 retry attempts with exponential backoff for file operations
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent retry patterns for transient failures
- **Context Tracking**: Complete audit trail with correlation IDs
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data validation before specialist handoffs
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced debugging and performance tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Patterns Implemented

### 1. **File Operations Pattern**
```typescript
// Before: Basic file reading
const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');

// After: Retry-protected file reading
await accessFileOrThrow(filePath, undefined, CRITICAL_OPERATION_RETRY_OPTIONS);
const content = await readJSONOrThrow(filePath, CRITICAL_OPERATION_RETRY_OPTIONS);
```

### 2. **Error Handling Pattern**
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded fallbacks
return data.destination || "Unknown Destination";

// After: Explicit error throwing
if (!data?.destination) {
  throw new DataExtractionError('destination', 'destination-analysis', filePath);
}
return data.destination;
```

### 3. **Context Enhancement Pattern**
```typescript
// Before: Basic context
const result = await run(agent, request, { context: { campaignId: 'test' } });

// After: Enhanced context
const enhancedContext = await createEnhancedContext(request, {
  campaign: { id: 'test', name: 'Test Campaign' },
  dataFlow: { correlationId: 'corr_123' }
});
const result = await run(agent, request, { context: enhancedContext });
```
